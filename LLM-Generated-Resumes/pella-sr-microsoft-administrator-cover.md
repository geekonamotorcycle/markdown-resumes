**Hiring Team**  
Pella Corporation  

Dear Hiring Team,

I’m writing to express my interest in the Sr. Microsoft Administrator position at Pella Corporation. With 17 years of direct  
infrastructure experience—including Active Directory, Azure AD, Group Policy, PKI, and Intune—I bring not only technical  
proficiency, but also the maturity and operational discipline needed to lead and document enterprise systems.

In my current consulting role, I manage identity services, certificate infrastructure, hybrid directory sync, and endpoint  
control for legal and nonprofit clients. I’ve led full lifecycle efforts, including application deployment, compliance  
documentation, and backup/restore planning using tools like PowerShell, Intune, ADCS, and Veeam. My client-facing work  
demands precision, clarity, and reliability—especially during after-hours maintenance and Tier 3 escalations.

Previously, I served as the senior engineer at a 30-year-old MSP, supporting over 100 clients. I was trusted to resolve  
complex access and identity issues, lead onboarding strategy, and enforce security controls in regulated environments. I was  
also the sole Apple support engineer and documented every recurring procedure in Markdown SOPs and Git-based knowledgebases.

Pella’s reputation for innovation, craftsmanship, and workplace excellence deeply resonates with me. I value your commitment  
to cross-functional growth and team development. I’d welcome the chance to bring that same clarity, trust, and execution to  
your IT operations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
**Joshua Porrata**
