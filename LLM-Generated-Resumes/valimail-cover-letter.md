# Cover Letter

Dear Valimail Hiring Team,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing to express interest in the **Senior Systems Engineer (IT)** position. With 17+ years designing and supporting secure infrastructure in regulated environments—including financial, healthcare, and nonprofit—I bring both deep experience and a passion for solving hard problems.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sets me apart is my direct experience deploying **Valimail's DMARC enforcement and email authentication tools** for dozens of client domains while serving as a Senior Engineer at a Managed Service Provider. I handled end-to-end onboarding: DNS cutovers, sender verification, BIMI setup, and organizational alignment for compliance. I understand your platform from the **customer engineering side**, and I see the strategic value it brings in securing digital communication.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond direct product experience, I’m a lifelong learner and toolsmith. I've built internal documentation systems, created automation tools to remediate permissions at scale, and designed hybrid infrastructure supporting Windows, Linux, and virtualization stacks.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I’ve designed a **highly efficient, version-controlled job search system** using GitHub and ChatGPT to dynamically generate tailored resumes and cover letters in Markdown. This process has saved me hours each week and demonstrates my comfort with **AI workflows**, documentation, and technical communication. Even this letter is version-controlled at [github.com/geekonamotorcycle/markdown-resumes](https://github.com/geekonamotorcycle/markdown-resumes).  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're looking for someone who understands your product, works independently, documents rigorously, and thrives in feedback-driven teams—I’d love to talk.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Warm regards,
