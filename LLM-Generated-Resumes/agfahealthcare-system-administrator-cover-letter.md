Dear Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my interest in the System Administrator – QC role at Agfa HealthCare. With over 17 years of  
experience supporting enterprise IT environments and a strong background in Windows Server, VMware, and secure  
infrastructure design, I bring a proven ability to meet the demands of quality control and production-ready systems  
in healthcare-adjacent environments.

At Summit Business Technologies, I served as a senior engineer supporting legal, nonprofit, and healthcare clients.  
There, I regularly performed disaster recovery testing, endpoint protection rollouts, and systems documentation for  
regulated environments. My work emphasized clarity, risk reduction, and hands-on responsibility in high-stakes  
situations.

More recently, I’ve led projects through my consulting firm, designing hybrid Active Directory and M365  
implementations, securing DNS and firewall configurations, and building Docker-based workflows to validate data  
integrity at scale. I also served in a compliance-focused IAM project at JPMorgan Chase, where I helped standardize  
unstructured data permissions across acquired banks—experience that sharpened my scripting, documentation, and  
collaboration skills on a global scale.

I’m confident my background aligns closely with Agfa’s needs, particularly where secure infrastructure, clear SOPs,  
and technical quality assurance intersect. I thrive in environments that demand reliability, long-term thinking, and  
a structured approach to change.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to speak further and learn how I can  
contribute to Agfa HealthCare’s mission.

Sincerely,  
Joshua Porrata
