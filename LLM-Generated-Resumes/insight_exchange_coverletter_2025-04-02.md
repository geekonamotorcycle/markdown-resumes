Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m writing to express my interest in the Senior Exchange Engineer position at Insight. With over 17 years of experience managing infrastructure for clients ranging from Fortune 500 firms to nonprofits, I bring deep technical knowledge, a proactive mindset, and a proven ability to keep complex email systems secure, scalable, and headache-free.

From Exchange Server 2003 through 2019 and into hybrid deployments with Office 365, I’ve built and maintained highly available environments using DAG, Veeam, and StorageCraft. I’ve optimized virtual infrastructure to maximize performance, developed PowerShell tools to streamline operations, and enforced modern mail security using Proofpoint, AppRiver, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and BIMI.

What sets me apart is my adaptability. Whether stepping into unfamiliar systems or cleaning up legacy environments, I quickly identify what’s needed and implement solutions that last. My remote work with MSPs has made me fluent in balancing client needs, uptime, and security without compromise.

I’d welcome the opportunity to bring that same focus and flexibility to Insight. Thank you for considering my application—I’d be happy to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,  
**Joshua Porrata**
