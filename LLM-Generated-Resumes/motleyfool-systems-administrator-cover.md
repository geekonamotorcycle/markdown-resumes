**Hiring Team**  
The Motley Fool

Dear Team,

I’m writing to express interest in the Systems Administrator position at The Motley Fool. With 17 years of experience across  
cloud infrastructure, identity management, and endpoint support, I bring the operational clarity and independent execution  
you’re looking for—especially in a remote-first, fast-moving environment.

Today I manage multiple EC2 instances, S3 backups, and SES-driven mail flows for clients through my consultancy. I’ve worked  
extensively with Cloudflare DNS, Azure AD, Google Workspace, and Linux systems. At Summit Business Technologies, I was the  
senior engineer at a 30-year-old MSP, responsible for everything from onboarding automation to final ticket escalations. I  
was also the sole macOS/iOS support lead, resolving Apple issues end-to-end without the need for external escalation.

Documentation is a major part of my workflow. I maintain SOPs, onboarding guides, and internal KBs in Markdown, published to  
Git repositories for version control and collaboration. I’ve built custom tools in PowerShell, Python, and Bash to support  
identity provisioning, DNS validation, and permission audits. I haven’t used Kandji or Terraform yet, but my proven ability  
to adopt and operationalize new platforms is a strength I bring to every environment.

The Motley Fool’s focus on clarity, self-direction, and purpose-driven technology is a strong match for how I work. I’d  
welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute to your operations team and help you scale reliably and securely.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
**Joshua Porrata**
