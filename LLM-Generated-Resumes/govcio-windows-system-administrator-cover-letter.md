**GovCIO Hiring Team**  
GovCIO  
Remote (USA)  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Windows System Administrator (Remote) position at GovCIO. With over 17 years  
of experience managing Windows Server environments, virtualization, and remote systems support, I am confident in my  
ability to make a significant impact on your team. My background in automation, technical troubleshooting, and  
performance optimization aligns well with the requirements of this role.  

In my previous role as Principal Consultant at RP Digital Consulting LLC, I managed multi-server environments,  
implemented virtualization solutions using Hyper-V and XCP-ng, and automated system monitoring with PowerShell. I have  
also led complex troubleshooting efforts, providing Tier 2 and Tier 3 support, and ensured compliance through rigorous  
access control management. My proactive approach to system reliability and security has consistently resulted in  
improved performance and reduced downtime.  

At Summit Business Technologies, I supported multi-site Windows Server environments, including Active Directory, DNS,  
and DHCP services. I developed standardized automation scripts to streamline maintenance and monitoring, significantly  
reducing manual intervention. My experience in data governance and permissions auditing at JPMorgan Chase further  
strengthened my ability to maintain secure and compliant IT environments.  

I am particularly drawn to this position at GovCIO because of the emphasis on proactive system monitoring and security  
compliance. I am well-versed in optimizing server performance, managing access controls, and implementing disaster  
recovery strategies. My commitment to maintaining robust, secure IT infrastructure aligns well with the objectives of  
your team.  

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills can contribute to the success of  
GovCIO. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Joshua Porrata
