# Joshua Porrata – Cover Letter for Software Engineer Role at Morgan & Morgan

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer position at Morgan & Morgan. While I am relatively new to
 the field of software engineering, my **17 years of IT experience** have provided me with a strong foundation in
 automation, system management, and infrastructure integration—skills I am eager to apply in this role.

In my previous roles, I have developed automation tools using **PowerShell**, **Python**, and **Bash** that have
 significantly improved workflows, increased efficiency, and ensured compliance across diverse environments. My
 experience with **cloud platforms** like **AWS** and **Azure**, combined with my strong understanding of **security**
 and **network management**, positions me well to contribute to your team's success.

I am particularly drawn to this role at Morgan & Morgan due to the opportunity to work in a
**collaborative, client-focused environment**. Although my background is more focused on system administration, I am
passionate about transitioning into software development and am eager to grow my skills further in this area. My
adaptability and commitment to continuous learning ensure I can quickly become an effective member of your team,
helping to develop and maintain high-quality software solutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to your team and look
 forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.
