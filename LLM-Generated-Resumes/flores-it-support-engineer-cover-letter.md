# Cover Letter

Dear Flores Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the IT Support Engineer position. With over 17 years of hands-on experience supporting users across regulated industries, I’ve developed a practical, security-first approach to help desk support, onboarding/offboarding, and endpoint protection.

Whether walking a user through a VPN login issue or creating a clean SOP for asset intake, I bring patience, clarity, and precision to every interaction. I've worked extensively with remote tools like ConnectWise, Intune, and Teams, and I've supported hundreds of users with secure Windows environments, AD access, password resets, and mobile device onboarding.

I'm based in the Greater Tampa Bay area and thrive in remote-first teams where documentation and accountability are valued. I'd love to help support the people who make your business run — and do it in a way that's secure, scalable, and easy to repeat.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to connecting with your team.

Best regards,
