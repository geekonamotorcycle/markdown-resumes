## Cover Letter

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Systems Administrator position at Fleetio. With over 17 years of experience in IT systems engineering, endpoint management, and automation, I am confident in my ability to effectively support your team. I am passionate about leveraging technology to streamline operations and deliver reliable, efficient systems.

Throughout my career, I have consistently taken a structured and detail-oriented approach to managing IT environments. My expertise includes implementing SaaS applications, automating routine administrative tasks, and securing endpoint configurations. At Summit Business Technologies, I led the deployment of Bitdefender GravityZone, significantly reducing malware incidents and saving valuable engineering time by automating threat management. This experience taught me the importance of balancing security with efficiency and making data-driven decisions to enhance IT infrastructure.

One of my key strengths is my ability to combine technical expertise with clear communication. At RP Digital Consulting LLC, I have successfully implemented solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, focusing on infrastructure modernization and privacy-focused IT strategies. My proficiency with tools like ConnectWise Automate, Intune, and Itarian allows me to automate processes, maintain endpoint security, and ensure reliable system performance.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity at Fleetio because I value your commitment to innovation and practical solutions. I believe my background in system administration and endpoint management aligns well with the responsibilities of this role, and I am eager to bring my skills to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications in more detail and explore how I can contribute to Fleetio's continued success.

Sincerely,  
Joshua Porrata
