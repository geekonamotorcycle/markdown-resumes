## Cover Letter

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Technical Support Specialist position. With over 17 years of experience in IT systems engineering, technical support, and customer relationship management, I am confident in my ability to provide exceptional support and contribute to the success of your team.

My career has been defined by a commitment to solving complex technical challenges and delivering outstanding customer experiences. I have extensive experience guiding users through technical issues, developing clear and accessible support documentation, and maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction in remote support environments.

In my current role as Principal Consultant at RP Digital Consulting, I lead client engagements focused on infrastructure modernization and privacy-focused IT solutions. My work involves resolving technical issues related to DNS management, email deliverability, and cloud platform optimization. Additionally, I automate routine support tasks using PowerShell, Bash, and Python, which improves response times and reduces manual workload.

Previously, as a Senior Systems Engineer at Summit Business Technologies, I provided support for over 100 clients in the legal, healthcare, and nonprofit sectors. My responsibilities included managing cloud services, virtualization environments (XCP-ng, VMware), and implementing secure email solutions. I developed support documentation to streamline client onboarding and trained end-users on best practices for maintaining system integrity.

I am highly skilled at troubleshooting a wide range of technical problems, including network configurations, email security (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and application performance issues. My ability to clearly communicate solutions and educate users aligns well with the requirements of this role.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because of your commitment to innovation and customer success. I am confident that my experience and technical skills make me a strong candidate for this role, and I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your team.

Thank you for your consideration. I am looking forward to discussing my qualifications in more detail.

Sincerely,  
Joshua Porrata
