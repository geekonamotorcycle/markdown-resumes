# Cover Letter

Dear TELYRX Hiring Team,

I’m excited to apply for the Network Administrator position. With over 17 years of experience designing, securing, and supporting infrastructure for regulated industries, I’m confident I can help strengthen and scale the networks that power your mission.

My work spans healthcare, legal, and nonprofit clients—many of them under HIPAA and PHI compliance. I’ve built VLAN-segmented networks, deployed and fine-tuned pfSense and SonicWall firewalls, created secure site-to-site VPNs, and diagnosed the kinds of issues that only show up at scale (packet loss, subnet collisions, unexpected broadcast storms). Every system I manage is documented and supportable by design—racks labeled, diagrams updated, and rule changes tracked in SOPs.

I’m based in Greater Tampa Bay and open to remote-only work. I’d love the opportunity to bring clarity and stability to your environment, and help make your network as easy to support as it is secure.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with your team.

Best regards,
