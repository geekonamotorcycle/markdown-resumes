## Cover Letter

I am writing to express my interest in the IT Specialist position at Synctera. With over 17 years of experience in IT systems administration, endpoint management, and technical support, I am confident in my ability to manage IT environments autonomously while delivering high-quality support to the team.

Throughout my career, I have excelled in managing IT operations for small to medium businesses, including configuring and maintaining Windows and macOS environments. My experience includes deploying and managing endpoint protection using Bitdefender GravityZone and ESET, as well as implementing secure access methods for remote work. I have successfully automated routine IT tasks using PowerShell, Bash, and Python, allowing for consistent and efficient system maintenance.

At Summit Business Technologies, I led the deployment of ConnectWise Automate for endpoint management, significantly reducing manual workload by automating routine maintenance and patching. I also developed comprehensive documentation to guide both end users and technical staff through troubleshooting and system maintenance processes.

I thrive in dynamic environments that require problem-solving and proactive system management. My experience with SaaS applications, including Google Workspace and Zoom, aligns well with Synctera’s requirements. I am also comfortable being the sole IT specialist, handling everything from onboarding and device management to troubleshooting and process optimization.

I am particularly drawn to this role because it offers the opportunity to work independently while making a significant impact on the company’s IT operations. I believe my skills and dedication to maintaining secure and efficient IT environments will contribute to the continued success of Synctera.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications in more detail.

Sincerely,  
Joshua Porrata
