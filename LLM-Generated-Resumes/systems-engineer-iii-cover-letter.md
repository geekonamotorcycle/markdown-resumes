**Hiring Manager**  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Systems Engineer III position. With over 17 years of experience in IT  
infrastructure management, virtualization, and system integration, I am confident in my ability to make a positive  
contribution to your team. My background in automation, disaster recovery, and cross-functional collaboration aligns  
well with the requirements of this role.  

In my previous role as Principal Consultant at RP Digital Consulting LLC, I managed multi-server environments,  
implemented high-availability virtualization solutions, and automated monitoring using PowerShell. I have successfully  
led infrastructure projects that focused on integration, disaster recovery planning, and proactive system maintenance.  
By leveraging automated processes and robust monitoring strategies, I consistently ensured high system availability.  

At Summit Business Technologies, I was responsible for managing Windows Server environments, including Active  
Directory, DNS, and DHCP. I developed scripts to streamline routine tasks and managed backup and recovery solutions  
using Veeam and Datto. My hands-on experience in virtualization using Hyper-V and VMware enhanced the efficiency and  
stability of client infrastructures.  

I am particularly drawn to this position because of its focus on system integration and high-level systems analysis.  
My ability to automate processes, manage system health, and document configurations makes me a strong candidate for  
the role. I am eager to contribute to your team and help maintain robust, reliable IT infrastructure solutions.  

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills can contribute to the success of  
your organization. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Joshua Porrata
