# Why?

I thought it might be useful to keep track of my various resumes and skill assessments here. This will help me organize
and track my growth over time, making it easier to showcase my skills and experience when needed.

## 2025 Master Skill List

[In my opinion, the skills list matters more than anything else here.](2025-Master-Skill-list.md)

The document linked above contains my comprehensive skill set. Itâ€™s constantly updated to reflect my experience and
expertise, and I believe it provides the most accurate representation of my abilities.

## Experiment: LLM-Based synthesized resume

[Here it is.](2025-Senior-systems-engineer-cloud-and-security-specialist.md)

The resume included in this repository is a product of an experiment using a large language model (LLM). While it's an interesting exploration, it may not accurately represent my current professional focus or abilities.
Please consider it more as a concept than an official document.

## Experiment: LLM-Skill-Assessments

I thought it would be an interesting idea to have the LLM follow a questions-and-answers test and assessments of
particular skills. I then followed up with real-life lab work in cases where a skill hadnâ€™t been used in the last year.
You might find this interesting.

[**You can find them all here**](LLM-Skill-Assessments)

1. [The first assessment was with Docker, something I operate daily.](LLM-Skill-Assessments/Docker-Assessments.md)
2. [This is a Windows assessment.](LLM-Skill-Assessments/windows-server-skills-assessment.md)

I did more of these, but I have not gotten to converting and posting them yet.

### Coming Soon

The following areas reflect demonstrated experience through technical discussions, solution design, and applied implementations. Formal structured assessments are in progress and will be added in future updates.

If you're a **Tampa Bay business**â€”or any organization with on-site IT staff looking to reduce costs, regain control, or **migrate away from VMware or the public cloud**â€”I want to hear from you.
