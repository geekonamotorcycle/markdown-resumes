# Why?

I thought it might be useful to keep track of my various resumes and skill assessments here. This will help me organize and track my growth over time, making it easier to showcase my skills and experience when needed.

## 2025 Master Skill List

[In my opinion, the skills list matters more than anything else here.](2025-Master-Skill-list.md)

The document linked above contains my comprehensive skill set. It’s constantly updated to reflect my experience and expertise, and I believe it provides the most accurate representation of my abilities.

## Experiment: LLM-Based synthesized resume

[Here it is.](2025-Senior-systems-engineer-cloud-and-security-specialist.md)

The resume included in this repository is a product of an experiment using a large language model (LLM). While it's an interesting exploration, it may not accurately represent my current professional focus or abilities. Please consider it more as a concept than an official document.

## Experiment: LLM-Skill-Assessments

I thought it would be an interesting idea to have the LLM follow a questions-and-answers test and assessments of particular skills. I then followed up with real-life lab work in cases where a skill hadn’t been used in the last year. You might find this interesting.

[**You can find them all here**](LLM-Skill-Assessments)

1. [The first assessment was with Docker, something I operate daily.](LLM-Skill-Assessments/Docker-Assessments.md)
2. [This is a Windows assessment.](LLM-Skill-Assessments/windows-server-skills-assessment.md)

I did more of these, but I have not gotten to converting and posting them yet.

## Get In Touch

If you're a **Tampa Bay business**—or any organization with on-site IT staff looking to reduce costs, regain control, or **migrate away from VMware or the public cloud**—I want to hear from you.

I'm an experienced systems engineer and consultant with strong vendor partnerships across the open-source and enterprise IT landscape. I help small to mid-sized businesses modernize their infrastructure without compromising reliability or user experience.

Some of the vendors I work closely with:

- [**Vates**](https://vates.tech/xen-orchestra/) – creators of **Xen Orchestra** and **XCP-ng**, providing a powerful, open-source virtualization platform that replaces both **VMware** and **Veeam**. With built-in disaster recovery, backup, and full enterprise support at a fraction of the cost, it’s a true all-in-one alternative.  
- [Cisco/Meraki](https://meraki.cisco.com/) – secure, cloud-managed networking  
- [TD Synnex](https://www.tdsynnex.com/) – global IT distributor with access to a broad range of solutions  
- [ixSystems](https://www.ixsystems.com/) – enterprise-grade storage built on open-source (TrueNAS)  
- [Pax8](https://www.pax8.com/) – cloud distributor for SaaS, backup, and security tools  
- [Ingram Micro](https://www.ingrammicro.com/) – global sourcing for hardware, software, and services  
- [Ruckus/CommScope](https://www.ruckusnetworks.com/) – advanced wired and wireless network solutions

Whether you need a second opinion, a project lead, or someone who can deliver a complete solution with minimal overhead, let’s talk.
