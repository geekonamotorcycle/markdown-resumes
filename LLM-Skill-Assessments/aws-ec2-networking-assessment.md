# AWS EC2 & Networking Skills Assessment

This document will serve as a structured technical assessment designed to simulate a real-world technical interview focused on Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically EC2 and core networking services. It will evaluate the user's applied knowledge of VPC design, EC2 instance management, security groups, NACLs, routing, snapshots, and monitoring via CloudWatch.

The assessment will consist of scenario-driven questions designed to assess hands-on understanding of AWS infrastructure design and operations.

**Estimated Completion:** April 22, 2025
